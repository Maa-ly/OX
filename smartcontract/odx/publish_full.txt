[Note]: Dependency sources are no longer verified automatically during publication and upgrade. You can pass the `--verify-deps` option if you would like to verify them as part of publication or upgrade.
[note] Dependencies on Bridge, MoveStdlib, Sui, and SuiSystem are automatically added, but this feature is disabled for your package because you have explicitly included dependencies on Sui. Consider removing these dependencies from Move.toml.
